# Redux-Second Router Sandbox

Think app _states_, not _routes_. _Flux Standard Actions!_ Yippey!

## Motivation

Redux-First Router was awesome and exactly the sort of thing I wanted for managing SPA applications with Redux. Unfortunately, the guy who made it decided to stop working on the project and go be a fucking lunatic on twitter, and what he left behind no longer functions with the modern Redux Toolkit workflow.

On top of that, he picked Flow over TypeScript for the project, and sorting that shit out _and then_ figuring out how to fix everything to work with Redux Toolkit is just too much to bear.

So I'm going to make my own Redux-First Router. With blackjack and hookers.

2. Tie everything in with the History API so we can fuck with the address bar
3. Learn how to make Redux middlewares or enhancers, or whatever fucking name they call those things, that will work with Redux Toolkit
